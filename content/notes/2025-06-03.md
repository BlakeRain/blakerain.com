I'm adding this note because I keep forgetting, and the Docker context documentation still doesn't
make mention of it: you can add a Docker context that uses SSH to connect to a remote
Docker daemon.

```sh
# Create a Docker context that connects to a remote Docker daemon over SSH
docker context create mycontext --docker "host=ssh://user@host"`

# List running containers in the context
docker --context mycontext ps
```
