I saw `microsandbox` on [hackernews], which reminded me of [firecracker]. Unlike firecracker, which
I think talks directly to [KVM] using [kvm_ioctls], `microsandbox` uses a [binding] to [libkrun],
which lets it work with Apple HV as well as KVM.

[binding]: https://github.com/microsandbox/microsandbox/blob/2d01cf699878096641dbe49173dd3cd597a794da/microsandbox-core/lib/vm/ffi.rs
[libkrun]: https://github.com/containers/libkrun
