  datacore: create dynamic views in Obsidian

I've added the beta of [datacore] to [Obsidian] (via [BRAT]) and the new queries are much faster.
Build components using React is quite wonderful (I think it is actually using [Preact]). I've been
able to migrate some of my more complex views I created using [dataview] to use datacore instead.

I really like that I can import React components from [other notes]. This means I can have a `My
Components.md` file in a `Templates` folder, and import components from code blocks in that note
into other queries:

```jsx
const { TaskList } = await dc.require(dc.blockLink("Templates/My Component.md", "code"));

return function View() {
  return <TaskList ... />;
}
```

You can also access the Obsidian [`app`] object via `dc.app`, which is useful for performing
operations directly on the vault. So far I've used this to parse various data from markdown files:

```js
async function loadSomeSuchFile() {
	const file = dc.app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath("Data/My Data.md");
	const content = await dc.app.vault.read(file);
	return parseFromMarkdown(content);
}
```

This function can then be used in a `datacorejsx` query. I'm given to understand that the returned
function cannot itself be an async function, which is consistent with how Preact works.

```jsx
const { loadSomeSuchFile } = await dc.require(dc.blockLink("Data/Data Functions.md", "code"));
const data = await loadSomeSuchFile();

return function View() {
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
```
