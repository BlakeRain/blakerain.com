  datacore: create dynamic views in Obsidian

I've added the beta of [datacore] (via [BRAT]) and the new queries are _insanely_ faster. Being able
to render using React is also a massive win. I've been able to migrate some of my more complex views
I created using [dataview] to use datacore instead.

I really like that I can import React components from [other notes], which means I can have a `My
Component.md` file in a `Templates` folder, and then import the components in other queries:

```jsx
const { TaskList } = await dc.require(dc.blockLink("Templates/My Component.md", "code"));

return function View() {
  return <TaskList ... />;
}
```
