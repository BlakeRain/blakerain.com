I learned from a [Reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1n27s21/bitnami_archiving_its_registry_of_images_starting/)
that Bitnami (part of Broadcom via VMWare) are shutting down all their OCI images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/bitnami).

> Starting August 28th, Bitnami will be archiving its OCI registry of charts and images to a new
> location, Bitnami Legacy, to make room for the new secure, hardened images that will eventually
> reside in the main Bitnami registry.

This seems to be part of a wider move to deprecate more of Bitnami's free OCI images in favour of
their paid-for image registry.

> While some BSI images will be free, they are only for use in development/testing purposes, and
> a commercial subscription is recommended for access to the entire catalog, as well as stable
> tags, long-term support versions, and more.

May be time to switch to [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/) where I'm not using the
official or custom built images.
