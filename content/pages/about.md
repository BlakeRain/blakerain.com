excerpt: Some information about me, what I do and have done.
---

Hello! I'm Blake Rain, a UK-based software engineer with a passion for Rust, C++, and Haskell,
though you'll often find me dabbling in Python and JavaScript. I'm a seasoned user of [neovim] and
a Linux and Unix enthusiast, recently transitioning to the Apple M1 as my everyday compute. As the
current Technical Director at [Neo Technologies], I work to bring innovative compliance solutions to
life.

Over the years, I have been privileged to work across diverse sectors, from film processing and
industrial automation to property management. My projects range from developing accelerated
post-processing software for the emerging digital film industry, prototyping control boards for
industrial automation, to creating tools to boost commercial property investment and contact centre
automation. Currently, I am working on a set of compliance tools related to PCI-DSS de-scoping.

These experiences have lead me to develop skills in system design, low-level system development,
Unix and Linux kernel development, electronic design, network development, firmware development for
embedded systems, functional programming, and user interface development.

# Projects I've worked on { .no-outline }

I have had the fortune of working on a wide range of projects in different industries: from film
processing to industry automation to property management.

- We built some accelerated post-processing software during the emergence of digital footage in the
  film industry, where we produced a suite of effects tools that delivered high-fidelity at
  real-time speeds.
- Industrial automation: design and prototyping of control boards and embedded software development.
  This projected was concerned with fluid control in chemical and waste processing, and included
  both user interfaces and custom controllers.
- A tool to assist in the sale of commercial properties. The dominant element of this project was a
  calculator for commercial property investment which could perform goal-seeking of multiple
  variables.
- Automated investment opportunity set optimization for commercial property investors. This involved
  searching a large set of opportunities, constrained by various parameters such as capital,
  preferred yields, LTV preferences, rent cover and so on.
- Contact centre automation, driving two contact centres in the UK. We built an adaptive dialler and
  campaign solution for the full automation of the contact centres at Inchora Home.
- A PCI-DSS de-scoping solution.

These projects have led to a fairly wide ranging experience:

- Lead system design: both small, resource bound embedded systems and medium-scale information
  systems.
- Low-level system development, including graphics pipeline optimization, JIT and assembly.
- I've built a few custom Unix (and later Linux) kernels for custom and proprietary hardware.
- Electronic design including schematic capture and PCB layout for prototype devices.
- Network development, mainly with Ethernet networks spanning the physical and link-layer to
  transport and protocol design.
- Firmware development for embedded systems: working with microcontrollers and FPGAs.
- Working with higher-order functional programming languages (mainly Haskell) and some work with
  automated deduction tools.
- User interface development in terminal applications and GTK; later moving to web-application
  development for my sins.
