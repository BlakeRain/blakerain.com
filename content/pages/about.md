excerpt: Some information about me, what I do and have done.
---

I like to believe I'm a software engineer. The languages that I use in my everyday work are primarily C++ and
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), although I also end up writing a lot of Python and JavaScript. My current editor of
choice is [neovim](https://neovim.io), although I sometimes use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and
the venerable [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for those [irreplaceable](https://orgmode.org/) modes.
[Linux](https://www.linux.org/) has almost always been my main operating system both personally and professionally, with
some Unix thrown in for variety. Recently I've moved to the M1 for my daily driver.

I currently work at [Neo Technologies](https://neotechnologiesltd.com/) as the Technical Director.

### Projects I've worked on

I have had the fortune of working on a wide range of projects in different industries: from film processing to industry
automation to property management.

- We built some accelerated post-processing software during the emergence of digital footage in the film industry, where
  we produced a suite of effects tools that delivered high-fidelity at real-time speeds.
- Industrial automation: design and prototyping of control boards and embedded software development. This projected was
  concerned with fluid control in chemical and waste processing, and included both user interfaces and custom
  controllers.
- A tool to assist in the sale of commercial properties. The dominant element of this project was a calculator for
  commercial property investment which could perform goal-seeking of multiple variables.
- Automated investment opportunity set optimization for commercial property investors. This involved searching a large
  set of opportunities, constrained by various parameters such as capital, preferred yields, LTV preferences, rent cover
  and so on.
- Contact centre automation, driving two contact centres in the UK. We built an adaptive dialler and campaign solution
  for the full automation of the contact centres at Inchora Home.
- A PCI-DSS de-scoping solution.

These projects have led to a fairly wide ranging experience:

- Lead system design: both small, resource bound embedded systems and medium-scale information systems.
- Low-level system development, including graphics pipeline optimization, JIT and assembly.
- I've built a few custom Unix (and later Linux) kernels for custom and proprietary hardware.
- Electronic design including schematic capture and PCB layout for prototype devices.
- Network development, mainly with Ethernet networks spanning the physical and link-layer to transport and protocol design.
- Firmware development for embedded systems: working with microcontrollers and FPGAs.
- Working with higher-order functional programming languages (mainly Haskell) and some work with automated deduction tools.
- User interface development in terminal applications and GTK; later moving to web-application development for my sins.
