# 2025-08-26

This evening was spent adding some [slash pages](https://slashpages.net/) to the site.

- Added [/blank](/blank) page. Intentionally left blank.
- Added the [/blogroll](/blogroll) page, listing other sites that I read and recommend.
- I removed the `/tools` page, as it was just a single tool that I no longer maintain or use.
- Added [/hosting](/hosting) page, listing things I self-host.
- Added the last four blog posts to the bottom of the homepage.

- Added the [uses](/uses) page listing the hardware and software I use.
- Reworked the menus and the footer links. Links are now on both sides.

# 2025-08-22

  directory has been replaced with a `.forgejo` directory.
