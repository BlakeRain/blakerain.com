# 2024-08-26

This evening was spent adding some [slash pages](https://slashpages.net/) to the site.

- Added [/blank](/blank) page. Intentionally left blank.
- Added [/changelog](/changelog) page, listing changes made to the site. This is the page that
  you're reading now. I had to generate some of this data from the [git log], which I edited
  afterwards to remove copious amounts of noise (`chore: ...` commits, etc.).
- Added the [/blogroll](/blogroll) page, listing other sites that I read and recommend.
- I removed the `/tools` page, as it was just a single tool that I no longer maintain or use. I
  removed it in
  [this commit](https://git.blakerain.com/BlakeRain/blakerain.com/commit/80e0f47562be10d8c2c3932a42f058275f3198b4).
- Added [/hosting](/hosting) page, listing things I self-host.
