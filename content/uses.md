# Software

- [1Password] - My preferred password manager.
- [Easy Move+Resize] - Move and resize windows on MacOS like you're using a normal OS.
- [Firefox] - My main web browser on MacOS and Linux. Specifically I use the [developer edition].
- [HammerSpoon] - Utility for automating MacOS, useful for emulating some of the features I miss
  from Linux desktop environments. Unfortunately I'm only using this for [launching terminals] these
  days.
- [LibreOffice] - A great open-source office suite.
- [Navidrome] - A self-hosted music server. I use this instead of Spotify or Apple Music.
- [Obsidian] - Note-taking and PKM application.
- [Raycast] - My application launcher of choice on MacOS. It's probably the main reason I use MacOS more than Linux.
- [SearXNG] - A self-hosted search engine. Used as my default on all devices where I have a choice.
- [Syncthing]  - For syncing files between devices.
- [Thunderbird] - A FOSS email client.

# Development

- [Atuin] - Share my shell history across devices. I self-host the sync server.
- [Neovim] - My main text editor. You can find my [neovim config] in my [dotfiles].
- [Tmux] - Terminal multiplexer, I use this all the time.
- [Wezterm] - The terminal I use on MacOS and Linux (thanks [@wez](https://github.com/wez)).
- [yazi] - A terminal-based file manager that I've recently adopted.
- [zsh] - My shell of choice. My [zhrc] is in my [dotfiles].

# Services

- [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) - Reading and highlighting. Works well with Obsidian.
- [Proton](https://proton.me/) - Email and VPN services.
